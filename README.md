# ScoreKeeperWidget

A simple widget to keep the score in a simple game where scores are incremented by 1 point at a time where there are 2 players head-to-head.

Players can select a total score that they are playing to for games where a target score for victory is necessary

Future goals:
- Add support for more players
- Add ability to add any given point value to the score beyond incrementing by 1
